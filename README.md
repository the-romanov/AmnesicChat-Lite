This is a *lite* version of AmnesicChat.

AmnesicChat Full: **https://github.com/the-romanov/AmnesicChat**.

As of January 29 2025, I will not be working on the full AmnesicChat to be able to fulfill school assignments.

AmnesicChat Lite has account identity security & Peer-to-Peer chatting option.

1. Idea

AmnesicChat Lite aims to create a secure, privacy-focused communication platform using advanced encryption and peer-to-peer capabilities.
The project focuses on:

- Top-Tier Security: Includes Yubikey Challenge Responses, fingerprint verification, and layered encryption protocols (e.g., AES, GPG, and Device ID-based hashing).
- Open Source: Encourages transparency and user trust by publishing the source code, allowing anyone to audit for backdoors.
- Lightweight Design: Optimized for low resource consumption, making it accessible to a wide audience.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems using Java, ensuring flexibility and wide usability.

2. How to use

Setting Up AmnesicChat:
- Install Java 17 or higher: AmnesicChat requires Java to run.
- Install Gradle 7.6 (you may be able to select later versions, I'm not sure)

**Full details will be completed once the project has some structure**

3. Compiling the source code

**Will be detailed, we build the source code using Gradle 7.6 and Java 17.**

4. Extras
